# Graceful Error Handling in React

This is a companion project to my post [Graceful Error Handling in React](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2023-03-05-Graceful-Error-Handling-in-React).

The project has three components that showcase ways to handle errors in React:
1. `FormValidation.tsx` has an example of a basic form validation field
2. `HandlingErrorWithHook.tsx` has an example of handling an error using a hook with an error flag
3. `HandleErrorsWithReactErrorBoundary.tsx` has an example of using [react-error-boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary)
